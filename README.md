# E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation

## Abstract
  A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the
market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the
companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like
previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on. 

## Problem Statement
  Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster
customers with similar interest. 

## Dataset Information

| Column | Description                            |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| Cust_ID| Unique Numbering of Customers          |
| Gender | Gender of Customer                     |
| Orders | No. of Past orders placed by the customers    |
---------------------------------------------------
Remaining 35 features (brands) contains the number of times
customers have searched them.


## Work Flow

- First Import the necessary libraries needed for the project. Below are the libraries that I have used
    - import pandas as pd
    - import numpy as np
    - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    - import seaborn as sns
    - from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
    - from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
    - from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    - from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer
- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Understand the data with basic statistics, info, total records, features and their data types also number of null values.
- Perform the data cleaning techniques like treating the missing values.
- Visualize the data with the help of Matplotlib or Seaborn to get better understanding of the features.
    - In my project I have used Seaborn's
    - Boxplot(To visualize the Outliers present in the data)
    - Barplot (To get to 10 customer ID based on Total searches)
    - Countplot (To get gender count and Prior orders count)
    - Heatmap (To find the Correlation)
    - Histogram (To get know how the data is distributed)
    - Below are some of the charts that I have plotted

- Perform the data scaling using minmaxscaler and data will be scaled between 0 and 1.
- Implement the Elbow method or Silhouette method to find the optimum number of K. Also visualize them with plots.

- After getting optimum K value use it as number of clusters and perform the model fit.
- The model will provide the output with different clusters.
- Analyed each clusters using visualization techniques to find the insights.

- Finally I got the conclusion ([Refer attached python notebook](E_com_cust_seg.ipynb)) by analyzing each clusters.
